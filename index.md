**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most intersting topic we've covered this quarter is how we can use machine learning to predict chronic bronchitic symptoms.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A potential investigation I would like to pursue next quarter is how we can use neural networks combined with multimodal data to predict mental health symptoms at an early age.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change I'd make would be to spend more time coding and a little less time reading papers. 

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Deep neural networks would be interesting to use in the project.
